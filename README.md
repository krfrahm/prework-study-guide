# Prework Study Guide

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

This project is to aid in the studying of codeing for the Coding Bootcamp. By creating this webpage I was able to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. This webpage will be able to be updated as I learn more and move further into the class.
